Employers may offer this job to a candidate at a salary outside of this range at their discretion.","how":"How is it calculated?","howEmp":"How is it determined?","howExplain":"To compute these estimates, we look at job-specific and company-specific attributes from the millions of salaries contributed by the Glassdoor community of users and employers plus other public and private data available to us.  We consider the age of the data we collect and may adjust it for inflation when appropriate. There is ongoing community feedback which further refines our calculations.","howExplainEmp":"When employers manage their jobs on Glassdoor, they have the option to specify an “Employer Estimate” salary range, which replaces any estimate generated by Glassdoor that might otherwise have been associated with this job.

A furlough is a mandatory, temporary leave of absence from work. It often leaves employees in an uncomfortable middle ground: They \u003ci>have \u003c/i>a job, but they can’t go to it. And while benefits such as health and life insurance typically remain, furloughs are often taken without pay and perks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"http://www.terrybmcdougall.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Terry McDougall\u003c/a>, career coach and author of “Winning the Game of Work,” says that companies often furlough employees when they are no longer able to pay them “but would like to maintain the employee relationship so they can call them back when the economic challenge has passed.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>But there’s no guarantee that employees \u003ci>will \u003c/i>be called back, McDougall points out. (In fact, she says she’s worked with clients who’ve waited several months to be called back into work only to find out they never will.) That’s why McDougal says that while loyalty to your current employer is important, “your first loyalty needs to be to yourself.” In other words, it’s totally OK and brilliant to look for another job — perhaps even one that pays more — while you’re on furlough.\u003c/p>\u003cp>However, if you decide to start a job search, McDougal recommends you don’t tell your current employer. It’s not about lying: “There's no guarantee that the employee will find a job,” she says, “and it’s not really the business of your employer what you do on your own time.” What’s more, if your employer \u003ci>does\u003c/i> have an opportunity to bring back some employees, “they may decide not to bring someone back if they believe that person may leave soon anyway,” McDougal explains.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Instead, McDougal says, it’s important to diversify your opportunities: “Maintain the possibility that you’ll be called back to your old job when the business improves while also exploring if there are other opportunities that you may be qualified for,” she says. “Don't diminish the possibility that you will not be called back because your employer thinks you’re ‘already gone.’” \u003c/p>\u003cp>If you start your job search and your employer catches wind of your efforts, then you’ll need to be transparent at that point. McDougal says you should tell your employer that you’re exploring your options if you’re not called back after the furlough. “Employers should understand that if they are not paying employees that they cannot expect the employees to sit and just wait for the possibility that they are called back,” she says. “The employee can let the employer know that they would very much like to be called back, and that’s their first choice — but that they need to take their own well-being and ensure that they have the income to support themselves.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>For some, it might be scary to look for another job while you’re on furlough. But McDougal has some encouraging and motivating words: “You own your career, and you need to take full responsibility for it,” she says. “Companies will lay off employees with little-to-no notice when it suits the business. Employees should always be looking to trade their skills and experience to the employer who provides them with the best value in exchange for those skills.”\u003c/p>\u003cp style=\"text-align: center;\">\u003cem>To help end inequality, shine a light on inequities in the workplace, and anonymously share your\u003ca href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/member/profile/demographics.htm?c=CONSUMER_BLOG_POST&utm_source=integrated&utm_medium=website&utm_content=blog-post&utm_campaign=diversity_demographic_update\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> demographics\u003c/a> to pinpoint pay and diversity disparities. \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/member/profile/demographics.htm?c=CONSUMER_BLOG_POST&utm_source=integrated&utm_medium=website&utm_content=blog-post&utm_campaign=diversity_demographic_update\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\u003c/a>\u003c/p>","protected":false,"api_jobs_widget":{"job_title":"Remote","job_age":"7","limit":"10"}},"excerpt":{"rendered":"The pandemic has upended many businesses, with some companies furloughing employees.

Many employees have been experiencing long hours of work to meet deadlines and keep businesses afloat, which alters employee morale, wellness, and motivation, which unfortunately leads to burnout. Although the concept of work-life balance varies across companies, Glassdoor Sr. Economic Research Analyst Amanda Stansell was able to look at Glassdoor \u003ca href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/mz-survey/start_input.htm?showSurvey=REVIEWS&c=PAGE_HEADER_NAV\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reviews\u003c/a> from the past six months to reveal which employers prioritize their employees' well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research found the monthly percentage of employee reviews in July 2020 on Glassdoor discussing mental health and similar topics rose 42 percent compared to six months earlier. Prioritizing mental health and wellness within the workplace is now more important than ever, not only to employers but also for employees suffering from chronic workplace stress. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Additionally, Stansell and the team analyzed millions of employee reviews on \u003ca href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/member/home/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Glassdoor\u003c/a> to identify the top 20 companies for work-life balance in the U.S. as COVID-19 heightened the stress and turmoil people across the world face in and out of work.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Are you looking for an employer that cares for your mental health and prioritizes wellness?
